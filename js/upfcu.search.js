Here is the list of candidates nominated to this years elections. Konrad KolodziejI was born Poland and in 1986 immigrated with family to the United States. I hold a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Lafayette College in Easton, PA. Over the past decade I have actively participated in various Polish organizations (such as the ZPA; lector at the St. Stephens Parish in Perth Amboy, NJ). I have served on the Board of United Poles FCU since 2005 in various positions. I have always worked with members of the Board to ensure strong future and growth of our Credit Union, but never forgetting the Polish heritage or the people who created and grew the Credit Union. My strong ties with the local community will allow me to promote United Poles FCU as a solid, honest and friendly financial institution. Experience of managing various projects, creating budgets and coordinating with other departments in my professional work will help me contribute to and ensure success of our Credit Union. I will continue to represent our members through hard, honest and proud work to guarantee that United Poles FCU is not just financial institution, but also a place we all can be proud of. Teresa RybinskiI was born in Poland and at the age of 17 came to United States of America. I graduated from Dickenson High School in Jersey City and Middlesex County College. I am presently retired, but for decades I worked as an accountant. I have been volunteering at the United Poles FCU since August 2008 as a member of the Supervisory Committee and was recently appointed its Chairperson as well as a voting member of the Board of Directors. My 44 years of experience in accounting has helped the Board and the CEO to analyze and make the decisions in governing our Credit Union. I would like to bring new ideas and suggestions to help our Credit Union reach its goals. Having been a part of the Polish community in this area for a long time, I understand the concerns and needs of our current and new generation of members. Voytek Wicinski I was born in Poland, where I graduated from Technical High School as Electronic Technician. In 1990 I came to the U.S. Since 1998 I have been involved with IT departments of various companies. I am currently working as a Software Engineer in childrens clothing retail company. My association with the Polish organization began in 2001, when my daughter started attending the ZPA Polish Supplementary School. When she was receiving Polish education I was involved in various ZPA activities and I helped in many events organized by the school. In 2006 I was appointed to the Supervisory Committee of United Poles Federal Credit Union. In April 2007 I was elected to the Board of Directors. I had different responsibilities during my involvement with UPFCU. I was Supervisory Committee member and then chairman, next I was selected as Treasurer\/Secretary. Im running for re-election as the Board of Directors because of my strong believes that it is important to give back to the Polish community. My main responsibility as a board member is safety of financial assets deposited at our Credit Union. I want to ensure that Polish people, as an ethnic group, have strong financial institution that not only meets our banking needs but also provides support to various Polish organizations. I want to ensure continuous growth of our credit union by not only providing service to current members but also by attracting more new members. Petitions will be made available to all interested at each of United Poles FCU offices on January 2, 2019. To be effective, nominations by petition must be accompanied by a signed certificate from the nominee or nominees stating that they are agreeable to nomination and will serve if elected to office. Petitions must be received by the Secretary at one of the Credit Union offices by the end of business on February 16, 2019. The mailing address is 412 New Brunswick Avenue, Perth Amboy, NJ 08861, ATTN: Petitions. Bill Of Rights What's good for you is good for your credit union. Because credit unions are not-for-profit financial service cooperatives- owned and controlled by the people who use their services- they work for the benefit of members. Because you're the force behind our credit union's growth and prosperity, and because credit unions work for members, you and fellow members can expect: A financially secure institution complying with the laws and regulations that govern it. A solid financial condition; responsible management of members' financial resources. Highly principled employees demonstrating integrity, professionalism and ethical behavior. Respectful, courteous, timely and unbiased personal service. Confidential records and transactions. The opportunity for your opinions to be heard and valued. An equal vote with other members, regardless of account balance. Volunteer credit union board and committee membership opportunities if you qualify and are elected. Dividend and loan rates that compete with and, whenever possible, offer advantages over other financial institutions' rates. Truthful advertising and disclosure of product and service rates, risks, charges, obligations, terms and conditions. Timely notification and correction of credit union errors and inaccuracies. Timely response to loan requests, account problems and suggestions. Recourse appeal and fair resolution of problems. Consumer information to help you make wise credit, savings and purchasing decisions, and to effectively manage your money. Check 21 Starting in October 2004, federal law will recognize a new type of payment document called a \"substitute check.\" The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, the law that makes this possible, will permit quicker processing of checks by allowing financial institutions to convert your checks to electronic images for collection purposes. Once the image is transferred, the financial institution may create, from the image of the original check, a \"substitute check.\" The government, media and industry call this new ability Check 21. While the financial industry is working hard to streamline the process and make use of new electronic technology, members will still be able to use the familiar paper check to make payments because the industry is designing a 21st century system that allows paper to work in the electronic world. Here's what to know about Check 21 and you: The \"float\" will disappear... More rapid processing of checks will mean less float (the time between when a check is written and when it clears). Members will have to make sure that adequate funds are in their account when the checks are written to avoid potential problems. Consumer rights are protected... Protections for consumers have been built into the law and the regulations. Losses in check fraud cases are typically borne by the credit union or the merchant that dealt with a fraudster, not the consumer. If you ever feel that there are problems with your account, contact us immediately. Check 21 should help combat payments fraud... The faster collection and return of checks facilitated by Check 21 should reduce overall fraud in the check collection system. What is a substitute check? To make check processing faster, federal law permits financial institutions to replace original checks with \"substitute checks.\" These checks are similar in size to the original checks with a slightly reduced image of the front and back of the original check. The front of a substitute check states: \" This is a legal copy of your check, You can use it the same way you would use the original check.\" You may use a substitute check as proof of payment just like the original check. Some or all of the checks that you receive back from us may be substitute checks. View a Sample Substitute Check What are your rights regarding substitute checks? In certain cases, federal law provides a special procedure that allows you to request a refund for losses you suffer if a substitute check is posted to your account. The losses you may attempt to recover under this procedure may include the amount that was withdrawn from your account and fees that were charged as a result of the withdrawal. The amount of the refund under this procedure is limited to the amount of your loss or the amount of the substitute check, whichever is less. You also are entitled to interest on the amount of your refund if your account is an interest-bearing account. If your loss exceeds the amount of the substitute check, you may be able to recover additional amounts under other law. If you use this procedure, you may receive up to $2,500 of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) within 10 business days after we received your claim and the remainder of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) not later than 45 calendar days after we received your claim. We may reverse the refund (including any interest on the refund) if we later are able to demonstrate that the substitute check was correctly posted to your account. How to make a claim for a refund? If you believe that you have suffered a loss relating to a substitute check that you received and that was posted to your account, please contact us. You must contact us within 40 calendar days of the date that we mailed (or otherwise delivered by a means to which you agreed) the substitute check in question or the account statement showing that the substitute check was posted to your account, whichever is later. We will extend this time period if you were not able to make a timely claim because of extraordinary circumstances. Your claim must include: A description of why you have suffered a loss (for example, you think the amount withdrawn was incorrect) An estimate of the amount of your loss; An explanation of why the substitute check is insufficient to confirm that you suffered a loss, and A copy of the substitute check and\/or the following information to help us identify the substitute check: the check number, the name of the person to whom you wrote the check, the amount of the check.

Share account opens access to other United Poles FCU services such as Checking Accounts with VISA Flex Debit card access Loans IRA & ESA Accounts An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is an excellent tool for retirement savings. Unlike most investments, depending on the type of IRA you choose, contributions may be tax deductible and will grow either tax-deferred or tax-free. Your tax adviser can offer more guidance on which type of IRA may be best for your needs. Of course, we are always here to answer your questions and assist you with opening an IRA. Please stop by or call us today for more information on the benefits of a credit union IRA. Traditional IRA Contributions are fully tax deductible if you don't actively participate in an employer retirement plan. Otherwise phase-out rules apply. Investments grow on tax-deferred basis. Earnings are taxed only upon withdrawal. Traditional IRAs are more attractive than ever because expanded income limits mean more people will be able to make tax-deductible contributions. In addition, penalty-free withdrawals are allowed for qualified medical and higher education expenses and for a first-time home purchase.* Roth IRA As long as you have earned income, you can establish and contribute to a Roth IRA even after age of 70. While contributions are not tax deductible, contributions and earnings can be withdrawn tax-free, and you are not required to begin mandatory distributions after reaching age 70. By converting your traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, you can enjoy tax-free withdrawals. However, the amount you convert is subject to income tax now.* Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA) ESA's allow you to put away up to $2,000 per year per beneficiary for higher education expenses, earning interest tax-free. While there is no tax deduction for the amounts contributed to an ESA, earnings grow tax-free. Your ESA can be used to pay qualified elementary, secondary school and higher education expenses. For more in-depth information go to the IRS Publication 970. Rollover Contributions Make sure your retirement plan doesn't get burned when you change jobs or retire. Just rollover you retirement savings into an IRA with United Poles FCU. You can have the funds directly sent to our Credit Union from your employer's plan administrator. If you'd like a cash payout instead, remember that the distribution is subject to penalty- up to 20% federal withholding (ask you tax advisor for details). *Individuals who have reached the age of 50 at the end of the year are allowed to make additional catch-up contributions to their traditional or Roth IRA.

It could take months or even years to learn you've been a victim. It can make it difficult to obtain loans, jobs, even affordable insurance rates... and worse, it could take years to clear your record. Your credit union considers identity theft a serious threat, and continuously monitors its security procedures to protect you and your accounts. But total security is possible only with your help. Here are steps you can take now to stop thieves from stealing your good name: Do not give out personal information, such as account numbers, on the phone or over the internet unless you have initiated the contact. Remember: if someone has a right to this information (such as your credit union), they should already have it... and shouldn't request it over the phone! Report lost or stolen checks immediately. Destroy unused financial solicitations before discarding them, and tear up other financial documents such as statements or receipts before discarding them.

The key advantages to home equity loans over home equity lines of credit are that home equity loans are simpler and more stable than lines of credit, the interest paid is at a fixed rate, and generally there are fewer fees and charges. A home equity loan is a more conservative home equity borrowing option than a line of credit and can give you greater peace of mind. Because home equity loans generally have a fixed interest rate, the monthly payment is also fixed over the life of the loan. A home equity line of credit has a variable interest rate and your monthly payments will therefore vary over the life of the loan. A home equity line of credit also gives you the option of making minimum payments on the outstanding amount  the option to make minimum payments can increase the interest you will pay over the life of the loan. Making minimum monthly payments or even partial payments that do not fully pay off the home equity line of credit during the life span of the loan creates a balloon payment  a large sum owed at the end. This situation is entirely avoided in a home equity loan where you must make fixed monthly payments that pay off the loan in full. A situation you want to avoid is taking out a home equity line of credit for purposes of debt consolidation. Use a home equity loan instead. A home equity line of credit works very much like a credit card so the minimum payment option in a home equity line of credit is not conducive to debt management and can leave you with a dangerous balloon payment at the end of your loan. What situations call for a home equity line of credit? A line of credit is the right choice when you need to access money at intervals or you do not know exactly how much money you will need. College tuition payments over the next four years are an example where money is needed at intervals. An open-ended repair or home improvement job on your home that spans a long period of time is an example where you may not know exactly how much money you will need and when you will need it. In both of these situations, you benefit by using the money only when you need it through a line of credit. Home equity lines of credit generally have a lower interest rate than home equity loans. They can be a good choice if you are borrowing a small amount and you know you will be paying it back quickly. Remember, both home equity loans and lines of credit serve a purpose. At United Poles FCU we can help you decide which one is best for you. Source: http:\/\/www.home-equity-loan-information.com\/which-home-equity-loan-type.html Should I Buy or Rent? Buying a home can be an emotional decision. You may find the perfect neighborhood, the home you have dreamed about, and see yourself sitting on the front porch before you consider how youll make the monthly payment! Keep your feet on the ground, take a step back and think how much house you can afford, the stability of your income, and your lifestyle. For example, if youre purchasing a home as an investment opportunity, be careful. Historically, while primary housing appreciates in value, its only in the single digits, while mutual funds or the stock market have appreciated 8-10%. You need to balance this information with the taxpayer benefits you will typically enjoy, such as deducting mortgage interest and real estate taxes on your income tax return. There are some great benefits to homeownership. You build equity as you pay down your mortgage and typically the value of your home increases over time. You also dont have to worry about housing costs escalating significantly with a fixed rate mortgage. But remember, when you own a home, youre responsible for its upkeep. If something breaks in an apartment, the landlord takes care of it. If you own the place, this is your problem. So make sure you dont put every penny of your savings into your down payment and closing costs. You might need money for an unexpected repair like a leaky faucet or new sump pump. In todays economy, there have been some great incentives for buying a home. However, if your job is not secure or you may need to relocate soon, you should probably wait. The costs add up, including closing expenses and commissions to real estate agents. You need time in your home to recoup that investment. If, on the other hand, your income is secure and you have found a place you can afford, talk to the Credit Union about your mortgage options. We would love to help!

Dont Forget to Roll Over Your 401(k). When you leave a job, dont forget about your 401(k). If you dont roll over your funds into a qualified investment vehicle within 60 business days of leaving your job, you could be subject to a 20% income tax and\/or a 10% early withdrawal fee. Also, if your previous employer gets into financial trouble, you could lose your 401(k). Keep whats yours by rolling over your money into an Individual Retirement Account with the Credit Union! Credit Card Concerns. Many families struggle to make ends meet and often resort to making purchases and payments with credit cards. Even worse, theyre only making minimum payments to these high-interest credit cards. When you pay only the minimum balance due, youll end up paying more in interest, assuming no additional debt is accumulated. Sound familiar? Apply for a Debt Consolidation Loan through the Credit Union. Well consolidate your high-interest credit cards and give you one low monthly payment. Insurance Shortfalls. Make sure to double-check your insurance coverage  health, life, car, etc. According to the US Census Bureau, 47 million Americans are without health insurance, and the number of under-insured Americans increased by 60% between 2003 and 2007. While you may be saving money now, if something were to happen, you could be paying much more! The Credit Union offers low-cost life insurance and GAP insurance. Ask us for more information. Make Punctual Payments. Save yourself some money by making prompt payments on loans and credit cards. When you miss or make a late payment, this information gets sent to credit bureaus, making it harder to obtain future financing. With the Credit Unions Online Bill Payment, avoid those late fees by setting up one-time or recurring payments on credit cards, loans, and other bills. You can also log in to Online Banking and make payments to credit union accounts with online transfers. Sign up today! Use Your Head, Not Your Heart. Many financial mistakes occur when you purchase or invest from emotion. Whether you financed a big-screen TV you cant afford, made an investment into a friends start-up company, or kept the house in a divorce for sentimental reasons, decisions made on emotion may leave you hurting financially in the long run. Give us a call and well help you set up a plan so you dont fall into the emotional buying trap. Source: www.finance.yahoo.com Retirement Checkup Retirement is not just something that happens. From choosing investments to protecting yourself and your family from risk, you make financial decisions that may help enrich your life not only in retirement, but each step along the way. As you get closer, its a good idea to assess your progress and review your retirement dreams and goals. Get Your Retirement Dreams Into Focus What does your ideal retirement look like to you today? You may have new ideas about what youd like to do and may even have a date in mind when youd like to retire. Have your dreams and expectations changed? Before you can make sure you have the funds to retire, you need a clear picture of where youre headed. Make the Most of Your Investments Just as you see your doctor or dentist every year for checkups; its also a good idea to review your retirement savings each year. You need to fine-tune your investment strategy to make sure youre still on track to meet your goals. Boost Your Retirement Savings You may want to increase the amount youre saving in retirement plans or save even more by going beyond what you save in a plan with your employer. If youre behind your savings goal, take a look at catch-up strategies. Manage Debt With Retirement In Mind Start mapping out your income and expenses, creating a comfortable balance that leaves you the flexibility to enjoy life with only the amount of debt you truly need. Consider becoming debt-free by retirement. For example, consider paying off your mortgage before you retire. Doing so may eliminate a major monthly expense, but you need to balance that against any tax benefit you might be giving up. By staying on track financially as you get closer to retirement, you are better prepared to create the future you want.
